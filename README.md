Object-oriented implementation!

Restaurant software that manages orders and creates invoices. It should be possible to view each table individually.
Orders should be taken per table. The products ordered should be noted for each table. Of course, there can be repeat orders.

•	Extras (extra cheese f.e.) – the price per special request should increase by 1 euro.
•	Leave smt. out (no cheese) – no price change.

An invoice should be able to be created at the end. In order to be able to resolve discrepancies, it must be possible to cancel or add individual items up until the invoice is paid.

Optional: order per person, not per table.

The products (dishes, side dishes, drinks, etc.) that are to be offered should be able to be read in via-file and used in the system (food.csv).

UI interface
•	There must be explanations on the console (inputs and outputs).
•	The program should not be aborted if an incorrect input is made.
•	The program should be able to be stopped with a specific input.
•	Invoices should be saved permanently in a .txt file.
